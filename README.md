# MemoRate 
It remembers, when you can't.

## Problem Statement
How do you keep track of how much you liked something? Remember it? I don't (at least not very well). Whether itâ€™s eating at a restaurant, buying a bottle of wine, or remembering whether or not you liked that babysitter you hired once last year, MemoRate is designed to track it with a simple:
- Title
- Photo
- Rating
- Memo (to future self)
- Custom Tags (for searching)

Basically, what do you wish you knew before you went to that restaurant, bought that wine, or hired that babysitter?  
Ask the you that lived in that moment; only they know how you really fealt.
